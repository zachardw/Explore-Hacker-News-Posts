    "# Exploring Hacker News Posts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this project, I will be working with a data set of submissions to popular technology site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), a site started by incubator [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), where user-submitted stories (\"posts\") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. It's extremely popular among tech and startup circles.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working with the following [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts), totaling approximately 20,000 rows with 7 columns, with the following column descriptions:\n",
    "* id: The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n",
    "* title: The title of the post\n",
    "* url: The URL that the posts links to, if the post has a URL\n",
    "* num_points: The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n",
    "* num_comments: The number of comments that were made on the post\n",
    "* author: The username of the person who submitted the post\n",
    "* created_at: The date and time at which the post was submitted\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "We are specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with **Ask HN** or **Show HN**. Both types of posts seek to engage and warrant response from the Hacker News community so our goal is to compare the two types of posts to determine:\n",
    "* Do **Ask HN** or **Show HN** receive more comments (thus engagement) on average?\n",
    "* Do posts created at a *certain time* receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "After analyzing the data, we can say first that **Ask HN** posts receive more comments than **Show HN** posts. Second, the time of posting has an impact on the average number of comments per post. Analyzing just the **Ask HN** post category, those posted at 15:00pm or 3:00pm ET receive, on average, the highest number of comments, and thus, engagement. "
